Description: ReservoirR is a simple user-friendly library based on Python scientific
             modules. It provides a flexible interface to implement efficient Reservoir 
             Computing (RC) architectures with a particular focus on Echo State Networks (ESN). 
             Advanced features of ReservoirR allow to improve computation time efficiency on 
             a simple laptop compared to basic Python implementation, with datasets of any size.
             Some of its features are: offline and online training, parallel implementation, 
             sparse matrix computation, fast spectral initialization, advanced learning 
             rules (e.g. Intrinsic Plasticity) etc. It also makes possible to easily create 
             complex architectures with multiple reservoirs (e.g. deep reservoirs), readouts, 
             and complex feedback loops. Moreover, graphical tools are included to easily 
             explore hyperparameters with the help of the hyperopt library. Finally, it includes 
             several tutorials exploring exotic architectures and examples of scientific papers 
             reproduction.
